# Development script.

# This script runs an Elixir REPL console in the context of the library
# and also a local webserver for the Drain application, all in the same
# Unix process.
# The REPL is exactly the same as executing bin/console, but when running
# alongside the Drain app it allows to debug the Drain and the rest of
# the HTTP server machinery.
#
# The Drain app will accept traffic on http://localhost:4000
