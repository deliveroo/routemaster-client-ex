# Changelog

## Unreleased

Changes:

* Ensure that `Plugs.RootPostOnly` does not accidentally block valid requests (it would happen because [`Phoenix.Router.forward/4`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html#forward/4) does not strip `conn.request_path` when used in scopes.
* The custom JSON parser used to assume that the request body on the `%Plug.Conn{}` hadn't been parsed yet. This was incompatible with how a Phoenix app defaults to parsing all request bodies in the endpoint, before entering the router, and required some custom configuration in the host Phoenix app. This has now been changed and the custom JSON parser will work with both not-parsed-yet and pre-parsed request bodies.
* ðŸ’¥ Breaking change: renamed the application from `:routemaster` to `:routemaster_client`, so that it matches the mix package name on Hex. The name mismatch was making installing and configuring the library more complicated than it should be. To upgrade to this version, it's required to update the application name in your project's mix configuration.

## v0.2.0

Enancements:

* Added support to publish events asynchronously with the new `async: true` option for the `Publisher` functions.

Other Changes:

* Documentation fixes.
* Updated dependencies.

## v0.1.0

First public release of the library.
At a high level, from the beginning of the readme:

* `Routemaster.Drain`, a [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug) app builder to set up endpoints to receive events over HTTP.
* `Routemaster.Fetcher`, a HATEOAS API client to get entities from other services.
* `Routemaster.Publisher`, a module to publish events to the event bus.
* `Routemaster.Director`, an interface to subscribe to topics, unsubscribe, list and delete (owned) topics, and in general interact with the API of the server.

A fifth private component is `Routemaster.Cache`, used by the `Fetcher` to store retrieved resources and busted by the `Drain` when new data becomes available.
